# Provenance record — full specification

Read before writing records, rather than improvising from memory of a previous run.
One file per identifiable result, in the producing node's `provenance/`, named after the
result (`summary.tsv` → `summary.md`).

## Required fields

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| `result:` | Path relative to the node, e.g. `results/summary.tsv` |
| `script:` | The script that produced it, relative to the node, with its `sha256:` on the line below — and the same for any library it imports that this node or the project owns |
| `invocation:` | The **exact** command line, every parameter included |
| `inputs:` | Each input path with a content hash |
| `environment:` | `environment/` (project main), or the node's `env/` |
| `seeds:` | The project seed and the derived component seed |
| `commit:` | The commit the script was at when it ran |
| `instructions-commit:` | The commit `AGENTS.md` and `.claude/` were at |
| `node:` | Path of the node, from the repository root |
| `produced:` | Date |

## Required veridical fields

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| `alternatives-considered:` | What else could reasonably have been done here, and why it was not |
| `agency:` | `human-set` · `agent-on-human-assessment` · `agent-autonomous` |
| `information:` | `agent-retrieved` · `human-pointed`, where the step rested on gathered information |

A record with only the first block is reproducible but not veridical. `alternatives-considered`
is the field that lets a reader judge whether the analysis was a reasonable one, and it is
the one that cannot be reconstructed later — write it while the reasoning is still in context.

## Worked example

```
result: results/cooccurrence_summary.tsv
script: scripts/summarise_cooccurrence.py
        sha256:5b1d9c…
invocation: ../.venv/bin/python scripts/summarise_cooccurrence.py --window 500 --min-count 3
inputs: ../01_prepare/results/regions_filtered.tsv  sha256:9f2c1a…
environment: environment/ (project main)
seeds: project 20260820; component 20260820-summarise
commit: a3f91c2
instructions-commit: 7b21ee9
node: analysis/02_measure/a_jaccard
produced: 2026-08-20
alternatives-considered: a median rather than a mean summary; rejected because the
  distribution is bounded below and the downstream test assumes the mean. A 1000 bp window
  was also reasonable and is run as a perturbation by the stability node.
agency: agent-autonomous
information: human-pointed (window size taken from the protocol in Archive/)
```

## When a script changes, append a section

A record is a running account, not a snapshot. **The digest in it has to be the digest of the
file that is there** — so a script that changes gets a new section saying what changed, which
commit it changed at, and what has run on it since. Earlier sections keep the digest they
name: each of them describes a run that happened under that version and is right to.

The failure this prevents is not carelessness. It is a batch appending its section when it
runs a script, changing the script again later in the same batch, and not appending again —
which is what happened at twenty records before batch 23, including the one for this
project's headline result. Nothing looks wrong afterwards, and that is the whole difficulty.

## What the invariant checker verifies

That every result has a record; that each record names an existing script, commit and
environment; and — the `hashes` check — that every file a record gives a sha256 for exists
and that the record names its **current** digest somewhere. It **cannot** verify that a
record is true: that the named script is the one that ran, that a digest is paired with the
run it sits beside, that a library the script imports is named at all, or that the
alternatives listed are the ones considered. Structural checking narrows where a human must
look; it does not remove the need to look.
