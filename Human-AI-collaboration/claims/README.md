# claims

`claims.md` holds everything the analysis supports: short statements, each bound to the
result grounding it, with its scope, the alternatives that would have supported something
different, and who authored it.

Maintained through `/claims`, which wraps `AI-internal/useful-scripts/claims.py`:

```bash
.venv/bin/python AI-internal/useful-scripts/claims.py audit
.venv/bin/python AI-internal/useful-scripts/claims.py check-text \
    Human-AI-collaboration/manuscript/<draft>.md
```

## What a claim may say

**A claim may state what follows trivially from the figures it cites — a ratio between two of
them, a ranking, a difference — and may not state anything that needed a step nobody ran.**
*(human-set, 2026-08-31, settling batch 17's question.)* The line is between arithmetic a
reader could do from the cited figures and a computation that would have been an analysis
step: the first is legible and checkable from the claim itself, the second is a number with no
provenance dressed as one that has some, which is what `AGENTS.md` §1 forbids. C23 states both
the paired difference and its standard error, and the 1.90 standard errors they come to.

Two things this file is for beyond writing the paper. It is the searchable record of what
the analysis established, independent of what reached the manuscript — including the
findings that did not. And it is the practical control against generated text drifting away
from the analysis: a sentence that cannot name the result it rests on does not get written.
