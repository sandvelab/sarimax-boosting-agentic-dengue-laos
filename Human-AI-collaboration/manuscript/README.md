# manuscript

The article. Written from `../claims/claims.md`, never directly from results.

Alongside each draft:

- `provenance.md` — what generated it, from which plan, on what date;
- a **provenance sidecar** keyed by paragraph or sentence identifier, mapping each statement
  to the claim it rests on. A sidecar rather than inline comments: more robust, survives
  format conversion, and can be published as supporting material.

Iterations accumulate as `_v2`, `_v3`; earlier ones are never overwritten.

Before submission, run `/claims check-text` over the draft. Sentences it flags are either
unsupported or point at a claim nobody recorded — both worth knowing, and the exercise is
meant to be slightly uncomfortable.
